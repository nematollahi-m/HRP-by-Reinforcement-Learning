### Prerequisites

* Numpy 
* stable baselines3
* Matplotlib
* Pytorch
* Gym

### Training
To train the agent for each of the objectives, the `train.py` code in the train folder needs to be executed.
You can set new paramerters for the model using the `Parameters.py` code, this includes the initial budgets, number of pruned plants, 
farm size, etc. We strongly recommend not to change the reward constant as based on our experiments 10 is the best value for it.

In addition, Hypereparametrs of the model can also be changed. This includes the learning rate, number of training steps, and exploration rate.
Based on the changes to the input parameters you may need to change the hyperparameters to achive the best 



## Pre-trianed Models
The pre-trained models can be found in the model folder.
